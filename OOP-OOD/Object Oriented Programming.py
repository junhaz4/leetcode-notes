Implementing Polymorphism Using Inheritance
Consider the example of a Shape class, which is the base class while many shapes like Rectangle and Circle
extending from the base class are derived classes. These derived classes inherit the getArea() method and
 provide a shape-specific implementation, which calculates its area

Abstract Base Classes (ABC): define a set of methods and properties that a class must implement 
in order to be considered a duck-type instance of that class.

Note: Methods with @abstractmethod decorators must be defined in the child class
Abstract methods must be defined in child classes for proper implementation of inheritance.

'''
Aggregation: the lifetime of the owned object does not depend on the lifetime of the owner.
The owner object could get deleted, but the owned object can continue to exist in the program. 
In aggregation, the parent only contains a reference to the child, which removes the childâ€™s dependency.
Aggregation is when objects have their own life cycle and child object can associate with only one owner object.

'''
composition: the lifetime of the owned object depends on the lifetime of the owner.
Composition relationships are Part-of relationships where the part must constitute a segment of the whole object. 
We can achieve composition by adding smaller parts of other classes to make a complex unit.
