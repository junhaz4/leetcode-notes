So, first we store the pairs {w[i],i} in an array(say v) where w[i] represents the weight of ith product and sort it in the ascending order of it's weights (here two items of equal weights will be sorted in such a way that the product with least index comes first).

We also maintain an array(say t) to store the information about the product. t[i] = 0 indicates that the i th product is not picked and t[i]=1 indicates that it is picked. 

Now we traverse the array(v) and for each element we check if it is picked or not. If it is picked, then we continue traversing the array. Else, we add the weight of it to the final answer and mark the adjacent products and itself as picked.
